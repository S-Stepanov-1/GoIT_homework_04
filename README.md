### Description

`This script was created as part of a training program at the GoIT school`

This is a console bot with which you can communicate via CLI. It implements the phonebook in a first approximation.
The program accepts commands and positional arguments separated by a space. The program knows how to save name (key) and phone number (value); it also knows how to change, delete and show all recorded contacts.
